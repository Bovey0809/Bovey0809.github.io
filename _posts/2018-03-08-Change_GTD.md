[The Art of the Finish: How to Go From Busy to Accomplished](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/10/18/the-art-of-the-finish-how-to-go-from-busy-to-accomplished/?inf_contact_key=6dd9218488d69732d9b25d1a690b637baaedbbb1f8deaebc88cfe0db9b266462)_

# Exist problem
- using the GTD system to divide whole project into little particles will make you never finish the big goal.

# Steps to construct a project page
- this is the method to fix the GTD backwards.

## steps
1. make an active projects list
    - using three spheres to divide projects.
    - List the most **important** projects in my life.
    - professional: school work
        - paper reading
        - udacity data analysis
    - personal: home. family, fitness
        - fitness at home.
    - extra: big projects
        - writing blog.
        - finshing papaer.
2. label each project with a completion criteria
    - this is the most different part from the previous one.
    - It is something like "complement is better than perfect.â€œ
    - A really concise description of what kind of level the mission should be arrive at.
3. Label the Bottom area of the page as a "holding pen"
    - This is the place for writing the remaing projects which incurred in the processing.

# How to use the whole system
- Each moring I should think about the most important projects that I should complete instead of tasks.
- The daily task should not be put in the system.
    - Should be finished using the leisure time.

# Finishing: Rest and Reload
- Don't start new project until finsh the project page.
- Once finished, relax for one week.
- Recharge during the leisure time.

# Why this works?
- Because the GTD style is not suitable for a longer project.
    - GTD always makes projects too  tricle to finish.
- By recharging yourself you can feel the power to finsh next projects which make a possitive loop compared with the GTD style loop.
