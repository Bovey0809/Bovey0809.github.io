# 为什么我要看这个文章<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Today I'm reading paper at home, but I find that my efficiency is too low to complish anything.
Such kind of situation makes me feel sick, for that I have a lot of thing that should be finished on time.
To make it be on time , I am looking for some useful method to help myself.

# Some tips which should be useful<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

-   The way to recharge your, work 90 mins and rest for 25 mins.
-   shorter work cycle, but should be working out of power everyday.
-   Goal breaks, set the weekly goal and break it into more detailed one.

# look lazy, be productive<a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a>

The author is doing something like being productive at any time. Which is exactly what I'm doing.

## Looking VS Being productive<a id="sec-3-1" name="sec-3-1"></a>

Being productive means doing things effectively but not in the off-time.
What I am doing is looking productive, but the result and output is the only thing that should be cared about.
So it is better to be productive rather than spend a lot of time with little efficiency.

## Work Hard, But have fun too.<a id="sec-3-2" name="sec-3-2"></a>

It is better to get things done rather than spend a lot of time.
So the main problem is to finish the work as much as you can, not staying working as long as you can.

# Double the output(while working fewer hours)<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a>

Everybody will feel that time is not enough, and here is the solution to fix it. As scott has complenmented MIT challenge in three months.

## Why you always have enough time.<a id="sec-4-1" name="sec-4-1"></a>

The problem within enough time. It's more depend on focuing. When focus on the work, it will save a lot of time.

## Why you can not focus?<a id="sec-4-2" name="sec-4-2"></a>

Focusing is one ability require energy, and energy is one resourse which can be gain by physical items like sugar or some chemisetries.

## Why time Management Hurts you?<a id="sec-4-3" name="sec-4-3"></a>

For everyone who wants to use time management skills aren't believing in the saying that time is enough for everyone.
So they do not manage their energy which means efficiency is lower than what they believe.

## How I used this to finish Mit classes in 5 days.<a id="sec-4-4" name="sec-4-4"></a>

here are the three disciplines should use.
1.  dedicate time off: evening is not for studying and also weekends.
2.  never sacrifice sleep: sleep is more important than studying.
3.  constrain your working time: working in less hours and intense chunks rather than working longer.

### Evening + one day per week = No work<a id="sec-4-4-1" name="sec-4-4-1"></a>

constrain the working hours so that I can  know when is for work and when is not.

### Never sacrifice sleep<a id="sec-4-4-2" name="sec-4-4-2"></a>

Sleep is the time for the brain to memory.Don't sleep means you can not memory enough things that you want.

### Constrain yout working hours<a id="sec-4-4-3" name="sec-4-4-3"></a>

You are not allowed to work outside the working hours. So 8 hours per day is the longest time one can work.
